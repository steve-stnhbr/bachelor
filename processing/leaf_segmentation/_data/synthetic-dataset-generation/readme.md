# Synthetic Dataset Generation

This repo helps you to very easily create your own instance segmentation dataset rapidly. What do you need?
The relevant resources, i.e. an image pool of

- background images (any sizes)
- objects of interest (in RGBA format)
- distractor objects (in RGBA format)
- splits for training, validation and test (of your resources) as described [here](data/readme.md)

The rest will be handled by this repository :) If you need help gathering data for the image pool, check
our [project page](https://a-nau.github.io/parcel2d/) with details on image scraping and asset selection.

This version was developed as part of a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09814) ([citation](#citation)), also check
the [project page](https://a-nau.github.io/parcel2d/) for more details.

## Usage

There two places to make configurations:

[config.py](src/config.py) to adjust e.g. (all variables are explained in the comments)

- number of objects of interests
- number of distractors
- max IoU between objects
- which blending methods are used
- ... (see [config.py](src/config.py))

[generate_synthetic_data.py](src/tools/generate_synthetic_data.py) to set

- paths to the resources needed for dataset generation (also see [Data](data/readme.md))
- number of images that should be generated
- flags for enabling occlusion, rotation and scaling
- flag for multithreading for faster image generation (recommended)

### Locally

Install the requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run

```shell
python src/tools/generate_synthetic_data.py
```

### Docker

Build using

```shell
source scripts/docker_build.sh           # for CPU
source scripts/GPU/docker_build.sh       # for GPU (faster Poisson Blending)
```

Run dataset generation using

```shell
source scripts/docker_run.sh             # for CPU
source scripts/GPU/docker_run.sh         # for GPU (faster Poisson Blending)
```
